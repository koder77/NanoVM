===========================================
Configure packetman

You have to edit the file nano/prog/packetman.conf:

If you have installed nano in your /home directory you set:

/home/yourname/nano/

That's all to do. Now you are ready to install packages.

Installs all include files and examples. With the remove option the files can be removed.

To update packetman, simply use:

$ nanovm packetman packetman.np install

Available packets:
------------------
base.np              includes and examples (important)
