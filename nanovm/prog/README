Compiling .nc programs
======================

$ nanoc tic_tac_toe
$ nanoa tic_tac_toe -lines=100000 -objs=100000


Running tic_tac_toe
===================

first shell:
$ flow 2000

second shell:
$ nano tic_tac_toe localhost 2000

And now enjoy the game :)

The other programs can be compiled/assembled the same way as
the game above.

The fractal program can be launched like the game too.
On Windows it can be runned with the nanovmjit with JIT compiler.


WINDOWS
=======

Now I build nanovmjit with JIT compiler enabled.
Run the fractal program to see it drawing the fractal with 8 threads and JIT compiler.
