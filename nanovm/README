Now with rights management.
This release includes the Linux X86_64 Windows X86-32 and Android ARM binaries.
Full source code is included too.


I updated the archive with new geographical includes which are working again.
There were some compatibility problems with the old code.
This is now fixed.


WINDOWS
=======

Now with a nanovmjit with JIT compiler!
I runned the fractal demo with it and it worked.


AROS
====

You have to increase the stack size to run Nano and the compiler/assembler:

stack 10000000

will do it.

This version of Nano is without JIT compiler for this time.
I have to build AsmJit first on AROS.



INSTALLATION
============

Latest tips how to do this can be found on the Nano Wiki:

www.jay-t.de/nano


Android
=======

Install flow.apk.
copy include, prog, fonts, home, nano-android-splash.scn and the binaries to /sdcard/nanovm.

Install the Jack Palevich's Android Terminal Emulator app.
Now install kbox2: http://kevinboone.net/kbox2.html, follow the instructions there.
If you are ready to run the terminal app, then do this:

cp /sdcard/nanovm/nano* /bin

This should copy the files nanovm, nanoa and nanoc to the kbox2 /bin directory.

Now Nano VM is ready to run.
More GUI programs can be added to the startmenu.txt file.
