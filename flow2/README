FLOW2
=====

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!
See ChangeLog.


This is flow, the nano graphics server.
To run it start it like this with a port number:

flow 2000

And to use a client programm:

nano lines 127.0.0.1 2000

Also see the graphic library in the main archive how to
use graphics.



COMPILATION GUIDE
=================

This is just a short help on how to build Flow.


Linux
-----

Just as usual:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install


ENV VARIABLES
=============

You have to set the environment variables:

in file .bashrc:

export NANOGFXFONT=/home/stefan/nano/fonts/
export NANOSFXSOUND=/home/stefan/nano/sound/

Just change the directories to your location.


Android
-------

Get the latest SDL build for Android via github:

$ git clone https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius

And follow the instructions in the README on how to make a build.

Note: it's better to use my binary for Android :).

The build script installs the APK file to your mobile device.
So this should be easy.



ANDROID README
==============

This is the experimental port of the Nano VM to Android ARM (ARM V7).

INSTALLATION
============

Note: The Nano directory should be copied on the sdcard:

/sdcard/
    nanovm/
        prog/
        include/
        home/
        fonts/
    
The created or opened files always are in the home directory!
You can't write to a different path!

You have to install a terminal app now. I installed the Jack Palevich terminal app.
It's on Google play.

And KBOX2: http://kevinboone.net/kbox2.html, it's a Linux environmnet for Android.
Follow the instructions there.

Now copy the Nano binaries into the /bin directory of KBOX2 shell.
Or copy the binaries to another location from where they can be executed.

Modify the home/startmenu.txt first line, it's the full path to the Nano VM binary.

Now you are ready to install the flow.apk file with the Flow GUI/graphics server.

I looked for a more comfortable way to install Nano, but this is the way it works.
Sorry for that.



USAGE
=====

You need the programs and include files from: www.jay-t.de/nano

You can run the compiler and assembler on Android, just like on Linux or Windows!


I included the tic tac toe game as a demo:

1. Start the Flow app.

2. Click on the "ttt" button.

3. Play the game.

Have some fun!
