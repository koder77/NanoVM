ABOUT
=====

This is Nano VM, a virtual machine.
Nano has a full 64 bit CPU core with registers for 64 bit integer, double and strings.
Programs for the VM can be written in assembly or my own high level language N.
Also inline assembly can be used from the N code.

The virtual machine supports multi threading and has a own virtual memory management
for array variables.

Execution can be speeded up by the JIT compiler (AsmJit library).
Currently only X86 CPUs are supported (32 and 64 bit).

Nano VM features:
- 64 bit CPU with lots of registers
- stack for function call arguments
- multi threading
- virtual memory manager for array variables
- JIT compiler
- file I/O
- TCP/IP sockets
- rights management
- virtual file system (own work directory)
- "hyperspace" data sharing between virtual machines
- "memory protection" in debugging mode
- assembler
- expansions with DLL/shared libraries possible
  stack and array variables can be accessed from library
- N compiler (high level language)


Flow
====

For graphics/sound the Flow server can be used.
Flow is connected over TCP/IP with the Nano VM.
So the VM and Flow can run on different machines/OS as a remote
control of the Nano VM. Or on the same machine over localhost connection.

You can connect the Flow server on your mobile phone with your Nano VM running on the PC.
With this setup you can run CPU intense programs and "take them with you" on your phone.

Flow server features:
- graphics/GUI with SDL
- sound with SDL_mixer
- serial port RS232 access (Linux/Windows)
- Raspberry Pi GPIO access (experimental)

NEWS
====

Now DLL/shared libraries can be loaded. This makes it possible to expand the
VM. There is a library to access the VM stack and array variables from the
shared library. A little example is included, it shows how to use the stack
and initialize an array.

Now with the Flow GUI/graphics server source code!
See flow directory.
Android version of flow is buildable with Pelyas SDL build environment.
See Flow README file.


COMPILING
=========

To compile Nano VM there are automake build scripts for:
- Android
- Linux
- Raspberry Pi (Raspbian Linux)
- Windows (tested with MinGW gcc compiler)
